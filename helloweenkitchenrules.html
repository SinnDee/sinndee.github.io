              		&#x2666; Chef or food related costumes (includes kitchen/cooking equipment) highly encouraged. If you need help or inspo, ask Cindy because she won't shut up about it.<br><br>
                  &#x2666; Address is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/T7uaxDrzDFKsqvei7" target="_blank"><u>6069 Zinnia St. Arvada, CO, 80004</u></a>. If you are participating in the challenges, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19yXafWSBFbXjUo4VEypzp8u4PeGWlqz1Mu5QYo1qaPg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><u>RSVP</u></a> and come on time. Window starts at 5PM and we will start promptly at 6PM. This is why we gave y'all a whole ass one hour window to get here. To entice you even more to come on time, we'll be providing dinner between 5-6PM before the challenges.<br><br>
                  &#x2666; <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzC-mAXBX8000Ru0t0356-OnE3kkU3buXtntgZeztOA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Please sign up for an item or two with the <u>sign-up link</u></a>. We will cover all the other challenge supplies and food, but need some extra help getting an array of alcohol and mixers for one of the challenges.<br><br>
                  &#x2666; Dogs allowed. We turned our backyard into a sand box for our furry children. If it's too cold, they can stay inside.<br><br>
                  &#x2666; Challenges will be about food, involving fruit, or making drinks. There is no direct cooking involved, but some of the challenges will be prep work needed for me to make cider during the game.<br><br>
                   &#x2666; Teams will be split into two, men vs. women, like the show. If we don't have an even amount, we will move people around.<br><br>
                  &#x2666; All challenges are estimated to complete in 2-3 hours. Yes, we left some time in the night to be degenerates.<br><br>
		      &#x2666; Friends don't let friends drive drunk. Feel free to crash here! We got 3 extra bedrooms (1 which is technically our office, so bring a blow up mattress if you want to), 3 couches, and 1 futon. If you're into it, we have an 8 person tent and an extra outside mattress for it. We're planning on making a fire and having sleepover vibes afterwards.
